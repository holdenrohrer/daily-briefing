We are working with SILE v0.15.13. In SILE v0.15.13, \script is
deprecated, and \lua must be used instead.

Your code will automatically be compiled, linted, and tested, so you do
not need to create or run any shell commands to accomplish this.
This will rebuild the brief.pdf for the user, who will examine it and
give you feedback.

When there is a choice between implementing something yourself and using
a library, choose the library.
If the library fails to install in Python, usually it's because the
environment isn't fully set up yet.
Ask the user to help you out and exit.

- Fix Facebook brightdata. Note that this'll have to be kinda asynch :(
- Youtube API
- OpenRouter /activity API

- Package this so that it can be executed as a systemd service. config.py needs to be in /etc/config.py, /run/${mktemp} for builddir, /var/cache/daily-briefing, cache rotation, move official.json out of cache. probably /var/lib

- Email flow should be more rigorous: some emails automatically include
  verbatim, some emails are automatically deleted
- DMARC emails aren't correctly interpreted at all. Easy fix.

- Some blogs should be full-context (TheZvi, pluralistic)
- Change the way that sections are configured.
    - Instead of "rss" being listed, then having a list of blogs, just
      do rss_feed("https://pluralistic.net"). a little more high-tech
    - This would make the previous suggestion much easier.

- Fix Facebook brightdata. Note that this'll have to be kinda asynch :(
- Youtube API
- OpenRouter /activity API

- Add rateyourmusic blog.

- Package this so that it can be executed as a systemd service. config.py needs to be in /etc/config.py, /run/${mktemp} for builddir, /var/cache/daily-briefing, cache rotation, move official.json out of cache. probably /var/lib

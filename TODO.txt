- Email flow should be more rigorous: some emails automatically include
  verbatim, some emails are automatically deleted
- DMARC emails aren't correctly interpreted at all. Easy fix.

- Some blogs should be full-context (TheZvi, pluralistic)
- Change the way that sections are configured.
    - Instead of "rss" being listed, then having a list of blogs, just
      do rss_feed("https://pluralistic.net"). a little more high-tech

- Fix Facebook brightdata. Note that this'll have to be kinda asynch :(
- Youtube API
- OpenRouter /activity API

- Add rateyourmusic blog.

- Parallelism/async. I already changed llm_json to async to break stuff.
